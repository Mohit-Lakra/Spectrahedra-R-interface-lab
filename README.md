# Spectrahedra-R-interface-lab
This repo is a small lab space for my GSoC 2026 work on GeomScale’s “Spectrahedra R-interface” project.

Files:
- `journey/day1.md` — environment setup + first successful build/run on macOS
- `tests/easy.md` — easy test notes (compile + run CRAN volesti)

Plan (short):
- keep notes small and reproducible
- focus on understanding the R ↔ C++ boundary and then implementing the hard test change spectrahedra-lab
